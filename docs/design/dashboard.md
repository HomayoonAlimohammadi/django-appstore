# Dashboard Design Document

## Overview

The Dashboard service will collect, aggregate, and display key statistics from the Appstore service (such as the number of apps created, verified status, sales data, etc.). The design aims to be decoupled from the core Appstore application while ensuring reliable data transfer and scalable analytics.

## Data Transfer

**Method:**  
- **Asynchronous Messaging (Message Queue):**  
  The Appstore service can publish events (e.g., when a new app is created or verified) to a message queue (using RabbitMQ or similar). The Dashboard service will subscribe to these events and process them asynchronously.

**Rationale:**  
- **Decoupling:** This method decouples the Appstore from the Dashboard service, reducing dependencies.
- **Scalability:** Message queues are designed to handle high throughput and can buffer bursts in event volume.
- **Reliability:** Ensures that all events are captured even if the Dashboard service is temporarily down.

## Data Aggregation

**Method:**  
- **Dedicated Analytics Database:**  
  The Dashboard service will use a separate database optimized for analytical queries. Options include:
  - **PostgreSQL:** Using summary tables and indexes.
  - **Time-Series Databases (e.g., InfluxDB):** For tracking metrics over time.
  
- **Batch Processing:**  
  Periodically, the Dashboard service can aggregate raw event data into summarized metrics (e.g., daily app creation counts, verification rates).

**Rationale:**  
- **Performance:** Offloading analytics to a dedicated database avoids performance issues on the primary transactional database.
- **Flexibility:** A separate aggregation layer allows for complex queries without impacting the performance of the main Appstore service.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Time-series databases can be more efficient in storing and querying historical data.

## Scalability

**Method:**  
- **Microservices Architecture:**  
  Deploy the Dashboard service as a separate microservice that can be scaled independently of the Appstore service.
  
- **Horizontal Scaling:**  
  Use container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) or auto-scaling groups to scale out the Dashboard service based on load.
  
- **Caching:**  
  Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed statistics to reduce load on the database.

**Rationale:**  
- **Load Handling:** Horizontal scaling ensures that the Dashboard service can handle an increasing number of apps and user interactions.
- **Fault Isolation:** A microservice architecture isolates the Dashboardâ€™s load and potential failures from affecting the Appstore service.
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching helps deliver rapid responses for high-traffic queries while reducing repetitive database hits.

## Conclusion

The proposed design leverages asynchronous messaging for reliable data transfer, a dedicated database for efficient data aggregation, and a microservices approach for scalability. This setup ensures that the Dashboard service can grow alongside the Appstore while providing real-time, actionable insights.
